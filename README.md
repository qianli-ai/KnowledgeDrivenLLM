Answer of AI agentï¼š

The early symptoms of esophageal cancer could include several of the options given:

A. Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) - This is a common early symptom of esophageal cancer. As the tumor grows and the esophagus narrows, swallowing becomes more difficult.

B. Pain behind the sternum - While this could be a symptom of esophageal cancer, it's also a common symptom for many other conditions, including heart disease.

C. Reflux of food or mucus - While acid reflux or heartburn is more commonly associated with conditions like GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease), it can also be an early symptom of esophageal cancer.

D. Temporary retention or foreign body sensation behind the sternum when eating coarse food - This could be an early symptom of esophageal cancer, as the tumor can make it feel like food is stuck in your throat or chest.

E. Loss of weight - Unexplained weight loss can be a sign of many types of cancer, including esophageal cancer. This is usually a later symptom, when the cancer is more advanced and affects the body's metabolism or causes difficulty eating.

Thus, the most appropriate answer could be "All of the above". However, the answer format in the provided question doesn't include this option. Therefore, the most characteristic early symptom among these would be "A. Difficulty in swallowing".

Please note that the question in the prompt seems to have an error. The answer "C. pancreatic dyschondroplasia" for the initial question about a patient with a bird's beak-like narrowing of the lower esophagus is incorrect. The description given fits Achalasia, which is a neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus not listed among the provided options.
